When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* to backup your work
* to share with a team
* to share with the world

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you don't know what changes others have pushed into the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of an existing published repository, so that you can modify it without affecting the original
A clone is a copy of a repository (local or public) 
A branch is a set of changes that differ from previous commits that don't affect those 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So that you can work while not connected to a network - you have all the change history locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

No. Not sure anything would be easier without using them, but it would definitely be harder to do almost any collaboration without some kind of communication process.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Anytime you are collaborating on a project and want to ensure that your changes are accepted into the project after they have been tested and reviewed.
